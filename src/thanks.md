## Hooray! You posted something

You can define any page as the thank you page. You came here because the URL of this page was defined as the _action_ of the form.

```html
<form name="contact" action="/thanks" netlify>
```

## Get your submissions

The submissions to your all of your forms are available form the [Admin UI](https://app.netlify.com/sites/{{details.sitename}}/forms), and you can also retrieve them programmatically via an API, and configure notifications and other useful things.
